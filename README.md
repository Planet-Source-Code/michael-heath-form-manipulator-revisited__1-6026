### Description

If you didn't see my previous form manipulation example then you gotta see this. This is some pretty good stuff, great for newbies. New Subs added! Don't miss out on this, you'll be happy you looked at it. Code all done in a professional way. Extremely nice routines for simple manipulation of any form. Cuts down your own coding. Heavily commented subs so that you can understand what's happening. If you have any trouble with this example(which you shouldn't) then email me and I'll make even more comments on the routines as I add new ones. Comments definitely welcome. Please, Constructive critism and praises only. 2/10/00, new routines combined and added. All subs tested and compiled! And yes, I did add a sample of the CustomMsg becasue I got a few emails about it. I sure hope it helps you all out. Check out the "StreakExit" routine. If anyone knows how to make that routine smoother, please email me with a fix. If anyone has anything to add, email it to me and I'll add it in and give you credit. Please remember, this is beginner level. I really hope that you find this example useful. Thanks for your comments and enjoy the code!

1. BooleanRollup
